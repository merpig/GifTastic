# GifTastic
A gifTastic Site!

## A simple design for browsing and keeping track of your favorit gifs!
- Nearly flawless web interactions
- - Unlikely, but, incase the site fails to load, you may need to clear localStorage
- - In that case you'll need to open dev console and enter: localStorage.clear()

- - Other known issues: If a gif doesn't have a title my favoriting function won't work, I've tried resolving. However, given the limiting nature of the api I haven't yet been able to fully test my solution.
- - General issue: If a gif doesn't have data in any one of the tags I'm getting, an uncaught error will arise

- Console.logs for all functions in a clean and clear manner
- - Makes the execution very easy to follow and understand!
